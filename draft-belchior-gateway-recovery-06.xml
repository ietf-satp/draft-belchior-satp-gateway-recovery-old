    <abstract>
      <t>This memo describes the crash recovery mechanism for the Secure Asset Transfer Protocol (SATP). The goal of this draft is to specify the message flow that implements a crash recovery mechanism. The mechanism assures that gateways running SATP are able to recover faults, enforcing ACID properties for asset transfers across ledgers (i.e., double spend does not occur).</t>
    </abstract>

<section anchor="introduction" title="Introduction">


	<t>
		Gateway systems that perform digital asset transfers among networks must possess a degree of resiliency and fault tolerance in the face of possible crashes. Accounting for the possibility of crashes is
particularly important to guarantee asset consistency across networks.
	</t>

	<t>

The crash recovering mechanism is applied to a version of SATP using either 2PC or 3PC, which are atomic commitment protocol (ACP).
2PC and 3PC considers two roles: a coordinator who manages the protocol's execution and participants who manage the resources that must be kept consistent. The origin gateway plays the ACP role of Coordinator, and the destination Gateway plays the Participant role in relay mode. Gateways exchange messages corresponding to the protocol execution, generating log entries for each one.
The crash recovery draft does not depend on the specific SATP messages, but defines procedures to recover from crashes and for rollbacks, independently of the specific protocol phase being executed.</t>

	<t>
Log entries are organized into logs. Logs enable either the same or other backup gateways to resume any phase of SATP. This log can also serve as an accountability tool in case of disputes. Log entries are then the basis satisfying one of the key deployment requirements of gateways for asset transfers: a high degree of availability. In this document, we consider two common strategies to increase availability: (1) to support the recovery of the gateways (self-healing model) and (2) to employ backup gateways with the ability to resume a stalled transfer (primary-backup model).</t>


	<t>This memo proposes:
(i) the logging model of the crash recovery mechanism;
(ii) the log storage types;
(iii) the log storage API;
(iv)  the log entry format;
(v) the recovery and rollback procedures. </t>


</section>

          
   <section anchor="terms" title="Terminology">

      <t>There following are some terminology used in the current document:
      <list style="symbols">

      <t>Gateway: The collection of services which connects to a minimum of one network or system, and which implements the secure asset transfer protocol.	
</t>

<t>
Primary Gateway: The node of a network that has been selected or elected to act as a gateway in an asset transfer.
 </t>
 
<t>
Backup Gateway: The node of a network that has been selected or elected to act as a backup gateway to a primary gateway. </t>

<t>
Message Flow Parameters: The parameters and payload employed in a message flow between a sending gateway and receiving gateway.</t>

<t>
Origin Gateway: The gateway that initiates the transfer protocol. Acts as a coordinator of the ACP and mediates the message flow.
</t>

<t>
Destination Gateway: The gateway that is the target of an asset transfer. It follows instructions from the origin Gateway.</t>

<t>
 Log: Set of log entries such that those are ordered by the time of its creation.</t>

<t>
Public (or Shared) Log: log where several gateways can read and write from it.</t>


<t>
Private Log: log where only one gateway can read and write from it.</t>

<t>
Log data: The log information is retained by a gateway connected to an exchanged message within an asset transfer protocol.</t>

<t>
Log entry: The log information generated and persisted by a gateway regarding one specific message flow step.</t>

<t>
Log format: The format of log data generated by a gateway.</t>

<t>
Atomic commit protocol (ACP): A protocol that guarantees that assets taken from a network are persisted into the other network. Examples are two and three-phase commit protocols (2PC, 3PC, respectively) and non-blocking atomic commit protocols.</t>
 
<t>
Fault: A fault is an event that alters the expected behavior of a system.
</t>


<t>
Crash-fault tolerant models: the models allowing a system to keep operating correctly despite having a set of faulty components.</t>


		
        </list></t>

		<t>
			Please refer to the vocabulary reference [VOC] for terms used across the SATP drafts.
		</t>
     </section>



<section anchor="lm" title="Logging Model">

<t>
We consider the log file to be a stack of log entries. Each time a log entry is added, it goes to the top of the stack (the highest index).
For each protocol step a gateway performs, a log entry is created immediately before executing and immediately after executing a given operation.
</t>


<t>
To manipulate the log, we define a set of log primitives that translate log entry requests from a process into log entries, realized by the log storage API (for the context of SATP, Section 3.5):
<list style="decimal">
		<t>
		 writeLogEntry(e,L) (WRITE) - appends a log entry e in the log L (held by the corresponding Log Storage Support).
		</t>
		
		<t>
		getLogEntry(i,L) (READ) - retrieves a log entry with index i from log L.
		</t>
		

		</list></t>


<t>
From these primitives, other functions can be built:

	<list style="decimal">
		<t>
		 getLogLength (L) (READ) - obtains the number of log entries from log L.
		</t>
		
		<t>
		getLogDiff(l1,l2) (READ) - obtains the difference between two logs.
		</t>

		<t>
		getLastEntry(L): obtains the last log entry from log L.
		</t>

		<t>
		getLog(L): retrieves the whole log L.
		</t>

		<t>
		updateLog(l1,l2): updates l1 based on l2 (uses getLogDiff and writeLogEntry).
		</t>
		
	</list>
</t>
		

<t>
Example 3.1 shows a simplified version log referring to the transfer initiation flow SATP phase. Each log entry
(simplified, see the definition in Section 3) is composed of metadata (phase, sequence number) and one attribute from the payload (operation).
Operations map behavior to state (see Section 4).
</t>
		

<t>
The following table illustrates the log storage API. The Function describes the primitive supported by the log storage API.
The Parameters column specifies the parameters given to the endpoint as query parameters. Endpoint specifies the endpoint mapping a specific log primitive.
The column Returns specifies what the contents of "response_data" mean. The column Response Example illustrates this last field.

<t>	Example 2.1 shows the sequence of logging operations over part of the first phase of SATP (simplified):

	<list style="symbol">
		<t>
		1. At step 1, G1 writes an init-validate operation, meaning it will require G2 to initiate the validate function:
   	This step generates a log entry (p1, 1, init-validate).
		</t>
		
		<t>
		2. At step 2, G2 writes an exec-validate operation, meaning it will try to execute the validate function:
   	This step generates a log entry (p1, 2, exec-validate).
		</t>

		<t>
		3. At step 3, G2 writes a done-validate operation, meaning it successfully executed the validate function:
   	This step generates a log entry (p1, 3, done-validate).
		</t>

		<t>
		4. At step 4, G2 writes an ack-validate operation, meaning it will send an acknowledgment to G1 regarding the done-validate:
   	This step generates a log entry (p1, 4, ack-validate).
		</t>
				
		<t>
Without loss of generality, the above logging model applies to all phases of SATP.

<section anchor="lst" title="Log Storage Modes">

<t>
	Gateways store state that is captured by logs. Gateways have private logs recording enterprise-sensitive data that can be used, for instance, for analytics.
	Entries can include end-to-end cross-jurisdiction transaction latency and throughput.
</t>

<t>
	Apart from the enterprise log, a state log can be public or private, centralized or decentralized. This log is meant to be shared with everyone with an internet connection (public) or only within the gateway consortium (private). Logs can be stored locally or in a cloud service, per gateway (centralized), or in a decentralized infrastructure (i.e., decentralized ledger, decentralized database). We call the latter option decentralized log storage. The type of the state log depends on the trust assumptions among gateways and the log access mode.</t>


<t>	In greater detail:
	<list style="symbol">
		<t>
		1. Public decentralized log: log entries are stored on a decentralized public log (e.g., Ethereum blockchain, IPFS). Each gateway writes non-encrypted log entries to a decentralized log storage.
		Although this is the best option for providing accountability of gateways, availability, and integrity of the logs, leading to shorter dispute resolution, this can lead to leak of information which can lead to privacy issues.
		The integrity of the log can be asserted by hashing the entries and comparing it to each stored hash on the decentralized log storage.
		A solution to the privacy problems could be given by gateways publishing a hash of the log entry plus metadata to the decentralized log storage instead of the log entries. Although this is a first step towards resolving privacy issues, a tradeoff with data availability exists.
		In particular, this choice leads to lower availability guarantees since a gateway needs to wait for the counterparty gateway to deliver the logs in case logs need to be shared. In this case, the decentralized log storage acts as a notarizing service.
		This mode is recommended when gateways operate in the  Relay Mode: Client-initiated Gateway to Gateway. This mode can also be used by the Direct Mode: Client to Multiple Gateway access mode because gateways may need to share state between themselves.
		Note: the difference between the mentioned modes is that in Direct Mode: Client to Multiple Gateway, a single client/organization controls all the gateways, whereas, in the Relay Mode, gateways are controlled by different organizations.</t>
		
		<t>
		2. Public centralized log: log entries are published in a bulletin that more organizations control. That bulletin can be updated or removed at any time. Accountability is only guaranteed provided that there are multiple copies of such bulletin by conflicting parties.
		Availability and integrity can be obtained via redundancy.
		</t>

		<t>
		3. Private centralized log. Each gateway stores logs locally or in a cloud in the private log storage mode but does not share them by default with other gateways. If needed, logs are requested from the counterparty gateway.
		Saving logs locally is faster than saving them on the respective ledger since issuing a transaction is several orders of magnitude slower than writing on a disk or accessing a cloud service.
		Nonetheless, this model delivers weaker integrity and availability guarantees.
		</t>
		<t>
			rivate decentralized log. Each gateway stores logs in a private blockchain, and are shared with other gateways by default. 
		</t>
	</list>
</t>

<t>
Each log storage mode provides a different process to recover the state from crashes. In the private log, a gateway requires the most recent log from the counterparty gateway. This mode is the one where the most trust is needed.
The gateway publishes hashes of log entries and metadata on a decentralized log storage in the centralized public log. Gateways who need the logs request them from other gateways and perform integrity checks of the received logs.
In the public decentralized mode, the gateways publish the plain log entries on decentralized log storage. This is the most trustless and decentralized mode of operation.
</t>

<t>
By default, if there are gateways from different institutions involved in an asset transfer, the storage mode should be a decentralized log storage. The decentralized log storage can provide a common source of truth to solve disputes and maintain a shared state, alleviating trust assumptions between gateways.
</t>
</section>

<section anchor="lsapi" title=" Log Storage API:">

<t>
The log storage API allows developers to be abstracted from the log storage support, providing a standardized way
to interact with logs (e.g., relational vs. non-relational, local vs. on-chain). It also handles access control if needed.

	<section anchor="SATP-2pc" title="Crash Recovery Procedure">

	<t>
This section defines general considerations about crash recovery for the self-healing mode. Note that the procedure for the primary-backup mode is the same, but first has a session resumption process.


	</t>


		<section anchor="crm" title="Crash Recovery Model">


			<t>
			Gateways can fail by crashing (i.e., becoming silent). In order to be able to recover from these crashes, gateways store log entries in a persistent data storage. Thus, gateways can recover by obtaining the latest successful operation and continuing from there. We consider two recovery models:

			
			<list style="symbol">
					<t>
					1. Self-healing mode: assumes that after a crash, a gateway eventually recovers. The gateway does not lose its long-term keys (public-private key pair) and can reestablish all TLS connections.


					</t>
					
					<t>
					2. Primary-backup mode assumes that a gateway may never recover after a crash but that this failure can be detected by timeout [AD76]. If the timeout is exceeded, a backup gateway detects that failure unequivocally and takes the role of the primary gateway. The failure is detected using heartbeat messages and a conservative period.

					</t>
							
					</list>	</t>

			<t>
			In both modes, after a gateway recovers, the gateways follow a general recovery procedure (in Section 6.2 explained in detail for each phase):


			
			<list style="symbol">
					<t>
					1. Crash communication: using the self-healing or primary-backup modes, a node recovers. After that, it sends a message RECOVER to the counterparty gateways.



					</t>
					
					<t>
					2. State update: The gateway syncs its state with the latest state, either by requesting it from the decentralized log storage or other gateways (depending on the log storage mode).
   If a decentralized log storage is available, the crashed gateway attempts to update its local log, using getLogDiff from the shared log.
   If there is no shared log, the crashed gateway needs to synchronize itself with the counterparty gateway by querying the counterparty gateway with a recovery message RECOVER containing the latest log before the crash.
   The counterparty gateway sends back a RECOVER-UPDATE message with its log. The recovered gateway can now reconstruct the updated log via getLogDiff, and derive the current state of the asset transfer.
   The gateways now share the same state and can proceed with its operation.

					</t>

					<t> 3. Recovery communication: The gateway and informs other gateways of the recovery with a recovery confirmation message is sent (RECOVERY-UPDATE-ACK), and the respective acknowledgment is sent by the counterparty gateway (RECOVERY-SUCCESS).
</t>
							
					</list>	</t>

	<t> Finally, the gateway resumes the normal execution of SATP.
</t>
		</section>

		<section anchor="rp" title="Recovery Procedure">
			
					
				<t>
			The previous section explained the general procedure that gateways follow upon crashing. In more detail, for each SATP phase, we define the recovery procedure:



				</t>


			<section anchor="tif" title="Transfer Initiation Flow">

			<t>
			This phase of SATP follows the Crash Recovery Model from Section 6.1.

			</t>

			</section>
	

			<section anchor="lef" title="Lock-Evidence Flow">

			<t>
			This phase of SATP follows the Crash Recovery Model from Section 6.1.
Note that, in this phase, distributed ledgers were changed by gateways. The crash gateways' recovery should take place in less than the timeout specified for the asset transfer. Otherwise, the rollback protocol present in the next section is applied.




			</t>

			</section>
	

			<section anchor="cef" title="Commitment Establishment  Flow">


			<t>
			
As transactions cannot be undone on blockchains, reverting a transaction includes issuing new transactions (with the contrary effect of the ones to be reverted). We use a rollback list to keep track of which transaction may be rolled back.
The crash recovery protocol for the Stage 2 (lock) and Stage 3 (mint) is as follows:


			
			<list style="decimal">
					<t>
					1. Rollback lists for all the gateways involved are initialized.


					</t>
					
					<t>
					2. On step 2.1A, add a pre-lock transaction to the origin gateway rollback list.
					</t>

					
					<t>
					3. On step 2.1B, if the request is denied, abort the transaction and apply rollbacks on the origin gateway.
					</t>

					
					<t>
					4. On step 3.4A, add a lock transaction to the origin gateway rollback list.
					</t>

					
					<t>
					5. On step 3.4B, if the commit fails, abort the transaction and apply rollbacks on the origin gateway.
					</t>

					
					<t>
					6. On step 3.6A,  add a create asset transaction to the rollback list of the destination gateway.
					</t>

					
					<t>
					7. On step 3.8, if the commit is successful (confirmed by the ack final receipt), SATP terminates (3.9).
					</t>
							
					<t>
				8: Otherwise, if the last commit is unsuccessful, then abort the transaction and apply rollbacks to both gateways.

					</t>
						
					</list>
				</t>

	<section anchor="session-resumption" title="Session Resumption">
	<t>This section explains how the primary-backup mode works for crash recovery. First, there is a session resumption phase. After that, the gateways perform the protocol specified in Section 5.</t>
	
		<section anchor="gateway-replacement" title="Gateway Replacement">
			<t>The gateway replacemenet protocol introduces an assumption. We assume every gateway has a valid X.509 certificate that was issued by its owner, which is the entity legally responsible for the gateway.</t> 
			<t>Moreover, in the extensions field of the certificate, there is a list containing the hash of the authorized backup gateways.</t>
			<t>When the primary gateway crashes, a replacement is bootstrapped with the latest version of the local state, and it engages in a protocol with the counterparty gateway.</t>
			<t>This protocol aims to establish trust between gateways and the creation of a new TLS session:</t>
		
			<t><list style="decimal">
				<t>
				Validate the backup gateway certificate by running a certification path algorithm, which includes validating all the intermediate certificates up to a trusted root (can be the VASPs CA).
				</t>
				
				<t>
				The counterparty gateway verifies if the parent certificate of the crashed gateway and the backup gateway is the same (proving they belong to the same authority). 
				</t>

				<t>Verify if the backup gateway certificate hash belongs to the list specified in the crashed gateway certificate extensions.</t>
			</list></t>

			<t>The backup gateway, on its turn, defines gateways to replace it in case of a crash (X.509 certificate extensions).</t>
		</section>
	</section>
	<section anchor="s" title="Security Considerations">
	
		<t>
		We assume a trusted, authenticated, secure, reliable communication channel between gateways (i.e., messages cannot be spoofed and/or altered by an adversary) using TLS/HTTPS [TLS]. Clients support acceptable credential schemes such as OAuth2.0.
		We assume the storage service used provides the means necessary to assure the logs' confidentiality and integrity, stored and in transit. The service must provide an authentication and authorization scheme, e.g., based on OAuth and OIDC [OIDC], and use secure channels based on TLS/HTTPS [TLS].
		The present protocol is crash fault-tolerant, meaning that it handles gateways that crash for several reasons (e.g., power outage). The present protocol does not support Byzantine faults, where gateways can behave arbitrarily (including being malicious). This implies that both gateways are considered trusted. We assume logs are not tampered with or lost.

		Log entries need integrity, availability, and confidentiality guarantees, as they are an attractive point of attack. Every log entry contains a hash of its payload for guaranteeing integrity.  If extra guarantees are needed (e.g., non-repudiation),  a log entry might be signed by its creator. Availability is guaranteed by the usage of the log storage API that connects a gateway to a dependable storage (local, external, or decentralized). Each underlying storage provides different guarantees. Access control can be enforced via the access control profile that each log can have associated with, i.e., the profile can be resolved, indicating who can access the log entry in which condition. Access control profiles can be implemented with access control lists for simple authorization. The authentication of the entities accessing the logs is done at the Log Storage API level (e.g., username+password authentication in local storage vs. decentralized access control).

		For extra guarantees, the nodes running the log storage API (or the gateway nodes themselves) can be protected by hardening technologies such as Intel SGX [CD16].

		</t>

	</section>	

	<section anchor="p" title="Performance Considerations">
	
		<t>
			After the session setup using asymmetric-cryptography, the authenticated messages in the TLS Record Protocol utilize symmetric-key operations (using the session key). Since symmetric-key
			operations are much faster than public-key operations, a persistent TLS connection delivers performance suitable for quickly exchange of log entries across gateways. Upon a crash, gateways might employ their best effort for resuming the crashed session.
		</t>

	</section>	
	<section anchor="a" title="Assumptions">
	
		<t>
			For the protocol to work correctly, a few assumptions are taken:
			1. the crashed gateways eventually recover, at most for a fixed time (or are replaced).
			2. Calls to the log API do not fail.
			</t>
